### *0.0.2 (06/02/20)*
----------------------
- **Due to a bug in Snapshot 20w22a, datapacks are not reloaded correctly when a world is opened. You will need to manually run `/reload` after opening your world to make the datapack run. (This bug is fixed as of 1.16 pre1. For future reference, here is the bug in question: https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-186478)**
- Fixed some misnamed tags preventing the datapack from loading.
- Added startup message.
- Added a few screenshots.

### *0.0.1 (05/31/20)*
----------------------
- Initial version: works in singleplayer mode only
